# Fun Fact Application

This project is an application that consumes my fun fact api and uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to display a random fun fact about selected subjects.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

First, I created the actual API that my app needs to consume. I added the necessary data to my server.js file and included a conditional so when each button is pressed, a random fact will be generated. Then I created a simple front-end application that fetches my API data and feeds it through the the user side.

## Lessons Learned:

At first, I had a difficult time differentiating the difference between the API and an app to consume the API. After taking some breaks and doing extra reading, I finally connected the pieces.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
